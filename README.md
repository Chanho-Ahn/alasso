## Requirements

We have tested this code with the following configuration:

* Python 3.6.9
* Tensorflow 1.13.1
* Keras 2.0.5

## How to run

For 30 tasks, run the following commands. 

```
python permuted_minst/train.py
python permuted_mnist/'Basic graph Permuted MNIST.py'
```

For 100 tasks, run the following commands. 

```
python permuted_minst/train_100.py
python permuted_mnist/'Basic graph Permuted MNIST.py'
```
